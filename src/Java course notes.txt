#3 First code in java

jshell was introduced in java 9 to run simple java code
When we write a code we need to compile the code javac <filename>


#4 How Java works

Hello.java --> complied using javac Hello.java --> byte code is Hello.class using java Hello --> runned by JRE(JVM)

Java needs jre to run the byte code because it might need additional library. So the jdk>>jre>>jvm
Jdk contains jre and jvm. WORA write once run anywhere which means compile the code and run any device which has jvm installed


#5 Varibles in java

In java declare the data type first then using the variable name

#6 Data Types in java (PrimitiveDataTypes.java)

In java we have two types of data types
1) Primitive data types
    a) Integer
        byte - 1 byte
        short - 2 bytes
        int - 4 bytes
        long - 8 bytes. For declaring long we need to declare l at the end. Eg: long ln = 1234566l;
    b) Float
        float - 4 bytes
        double - 8 bytes . In java if we dont declare point values it will by default takes double.
            If we want to have float we need to declare f at the end. Eg: float fl = 5.6f;
    c) Character
        char - 2 bytes java follows UNICODE
    d) Boolean
        boolean - true or false. In java we dont have 0 or 1. It is not valid in java.

#7 literal in java (PrimitiveDataTypes.java)
    literals are the literal values which we assign. Eg: int num = 7; Here 7 is the literal
    we can also work with base 2. Eg: int num = 0b101;
    we can work with hexadecimal numbers. Eg: int hexa = 0xE7;
    Long numbers can add underscore for easy reading. Eg: double value = 10_00_00_000;
    we can use epsilon in between. Eg double distance = 12e10;
    characters can be printed as number. Eg char letter = 'a'; c++;  we will get letter as b. As it is incremented.
